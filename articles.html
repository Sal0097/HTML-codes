        </summary>
        <p> A recent study challenges traditional views on how Earth’s continents were formed, suggesting that subduction may not have been necessary. His findings propose that the melting of Earth’s crust could explain the formation of continents, casting doubt on when plate tectonics began and highlighting its impact on life’s origin.<a href="https://scitechdaily.com/reimagining-earths-history-new-study-challenges-long-held-theories-of-continent-formation/" target="_blank">Read more↗️</a>​</p><br>
